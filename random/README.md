# Pseudo Random Number Generators

generators contains any prng imlementations, then the tests directory 
contains various empirical tests of their randomness.

These are largely pulling from Knuth's TAOCP V2 section 3.3.2, which begins
with the lovely quote:

> The equanimity of your average tosser of coins
> depends upon a law .. which ensures that
> he will not upset himself by losing too much
> nor upset his opponent by winning too often.

- Tom Stoppard, Rosencrantz & Guildenstern are Dead (1966)
